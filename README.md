Water Reminder follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern and leverages SwiftUI for a clean, declarative UI.

  - `WaterManager`: Manages water intake data, goals, and notifications

- **Views**: User interface components
  - `HomeView`: Main screen showing progress and quick add buttons
  - `StatsView`: Visualizations of daily and weekly water intake
  - `SettingsView`: Customization options for goals and reminders

- **WatchOS Integration**: 
  - `WatchConnectivityManager`: Handles communication between iOS and watchOS
  - `WatchContentView`: Simplified interface for Apple Watch

- **Widget**:
  - `WaterReminderWidget`: Home screen widget showing current progress

## Apple Watch Features

The companion Apple Watch app provides:

- At-a-glance progress visualization
- Quick-add buttons for common amounts (100ml, 200ml, 300ml)
